# Book-keeper API
The Book-keeper API is a robust REST service built with Java and the Spring Boot framework, 
designed to manage a simple online bookstore.

#### TECHNOLOGY USED
- **Java**: Programming language
- **Maven**: Build tool and project management
- **SpringBoot (Reactive/WebFlux)**: Framework for building Java-based enterprise applications
- **Postgres**: Relational database for data storage
- **Swagger (SpringDoc)**: API documentation tool
- **Docker**: Containerization platform
- **Faker**: Tool for generating fake data for testing purposes


#### DESIGN EXPLANATION
The Book-keeper API is monolithic application, designed to follow RESTful principles, 
with each endpoint representing a specific resource and supporting standard CRUD operations. 
The application utilizes a reactive programming model with Spring Boot's WebFlux framework for improved scalability.
All endpoints (aside the user registration endpoint) are protected, 
hence users are required to register either as an admin or a user.
Only users with admin role can register/update books, all  other users can retrieve books.
